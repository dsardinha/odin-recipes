        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 chicken thighs bone-in/skin-on</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper divided</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves minced</li>
            <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1.9 pounds small waxy potatoes cut into wedges</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>3 ounces feta crumbled</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper for topping</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped parsley for serving</li>
            <li>lemon zest for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Start with preparing the chicken thighs. Rub ½ teaspoon salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut ½ of the lemon in thin half moon slices, mince the garlic and slice the potatoes into wedges. Chop the parsley.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and butter over medium in an ovenproof skillet or pan. Place chicken thighs skin-side down, cook for 10 minutes, move chicken around every couple of minutes to prevent them from sticking to the bottom. Turn, cook for 5 minutes more. Remove thighs from skillet onto a clean plate.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, cook for 30 seconds. Stir in oregano and the remaining salt and pepper. Add potatoes, cook for 2 minutes. Pour in broth and place chicken thighs on top of the potatoes, skin-side up. Sprinkle with juice from the remaining lemon half and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven. Nestle lemon slice between chicken and potatoes. Crumble the feta cheese on top and season with freshly ground black pepper. Reduce heat to 320°F/160°C, slide everything back into the oven and bake for 20 minutes more or until the chicken thighs are cooked through and tender.</li>
            <li>When ready, finish off with parsley and lemon zest. Enjoy!</li>
